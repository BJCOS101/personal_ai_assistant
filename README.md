### Personal AI Knowledge Assistant - Complete Implementation Guide

1. Project Summary

Overview
Build a personal AI knowledge assistant that ingests your documents (PDFs, markdown files, text files), creates searchable embeddings, and provides a conversational chat interface to query your knowledge base with cited sources. Think of it as "ChatGPT for your personal documents" with accurate retrieval and source attribution.
Main Goals

Ingest and process multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX)
Create vector embeddings for semantic search
Provide conversational interface with natural language queries
Cite sources in responses with exact document references
Maintain conversation history for context-aware follow-ups

Technology Choices & Rationale
Backend: Python + FastAPI

Python has the best AI/ML ecosystem (LangChain, transformers, etc.)
FastAPI provides async support, automatic API docs, and is production-ready
Easy WebSocket support for real-time chat

Vector Database: ChromaDB

Free, open-source, runs locally (no API keys needed initially)
Simple Python integration
Persistent storage
Can migrate to Pinecone/Weaviate later if needed

LLM: OpenAI API (with fallback to local models)

Best quality responses for MVP
Easy to swap for Claude/local models later
We'll structure code to be LLM-agnostic

Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small

Cost-effective ($0.02 per 1M tokens)
High quality semantic search
Alternative: sentence-transformers (free, local)

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

Modern, component-based UI
TypeScript for type safety
Tailwind for rapid styling

Document Processing:

PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDFs
python-docx for Word documents
Basic text parsers for MD/TXT

Assumptions

You have documents stored locally in a folder
You're willing to use OpenAI API (we'll show free alternatives)
You want a web-based interface (not CLI)
Documents are in English (easy to extend for multilingual)


2. Architecture & File Structure

System Architecture
User → React Frontend → FastAPI Backend → LangChain → ChromaDB

Component Responsibilities
Backend Components:

main.py: FastAPI app initialization, CORS, middleware
config.py: Environment variables, API keys, paths
models.py: Request/response schemas (QueryRequest, ChatResponse, etc.)
document_processor.py: Extract text from PDFs/DOCX, split into chunks
vector_store.py: ChromaDB operations (add, query, delete)
chat_service.py: RAG pipeline, LLM prompting, source citation
embeddings.py: Generate embeddings (OpenAI or local)
routes.py: REST endpoints for document management
websocket.py: Real-time chat via WebSocket

Frontend Components:

Commands:

cd frontend
npm run dev

to restart frontend: (Ctrl + C)


cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m app.main

to restart backend: (Ctrl + C) or deactivate


ill make a script for everything eventually



need to use virtual environemnet for backend, use python 3.12

deactivate
rm -rf venv

python3.11 --version
# OR
python3.12 --version
# OR
python3.10 --version


# Use the specific python version to create the venv
python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate the new environment
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m app.main




Using Free AI Models - Complete Integration Guide
Great choice! Let's replace OpenAI with free, open-source models that run locally. For your use case (searching and analyzing documents), I'll guide you through the best options.
Best Free Model Options for Your Project
Recommended Setup (Best Balance)
For Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Fast, lightweight (80MB)
Good semantic search quality
Runs on CPU efficiently

For LLM (Text Generation): Choose one based on your hardware:

Mistral-7B-Instruct (Recommended - Best Quality)

7B parameters
Excellent instruction following
Requires ~8GB RAM (or 4GB VRAM for GPU)
Via Hugging Face Transformers or Ollama


Phi-3-mini (Lightweight Alternative)

3.8B parameters
Good quality, very fast
Requires ~4GB RAM
Great for laptops/lower-end hardware


LLaMA 3.2 3B (Latest from Meta)

3B parameters
State-of-the-art for its size
Requires ~4GB RAM



My Recommendation: Ollama + Mistral 7B
Why Ollama?

Easiest setup (one command)
Automatic model management
Optimized inference
Works on CPU and GPU
Simple API (OpenAI-compatible)






Verdict: It is working exactly as designed.

You might be thinking, "Wait, I thought AI was smart? Why doesn't it know Paris is the capital of France?"

The Reason: You built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application.

Standard ChatGPT: Uses its own memory of the internet to answer anything.

Your App: Is specifically programmed to ignore its own memory and only use the documents you give it.









Here is the consolidated setup guide for your README.md.

Since you have already modified the code files (main.py, chat_service.py, etc.) to use Groq and local embeddings, a new user simply needs to install the correct libraries and add their keys.

You can copy-paste the sections below directly into your README.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

Node.js & npm

Groq API Key (Get one for free at console.groq.com)

1. Backend Setup (The Brain)
Navigate to the backend folder:

Bash

cd backend
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

Bash

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies: These are the specific libraries needed for Groq and Local Embeddings:

Bash

pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-groq langchain-huggingface sentence-transformers python-dotenv langchain-text-splitters uvicorn fastapi
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a file named .env in the backend folder.

Add your Groq API key and the telemetry setting:

Code snippet

GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
Start the Server:

Bash

python -m app.main
The server should start at http://localhost:8000.

2. Frontend Setup (The Interface)
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

Bash

cd frontend
Install Dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the Application:

Bash

npm start
The application should open at http://localhost:3000.

3. Usage Guide
Open the web interface (http://localhost:3000).

Upload a Document: Drag and drop a PDF or TXT file (e.g., notes.txt) to the sidebar.

Note: Since this uses RAG, the bot will NOT answer questions until you give it a document to read.

Ask a Question: Type a question related to the document you just uploaded.

💡 Troubleshooting
"Capture() takes 1 positional argument...": Ensure ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False is in your .env file and that you have restarted the backend.

ModuleNotFound Errors: Ensure you activated the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate) before running the server.
